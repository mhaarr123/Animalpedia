              <h2>Cassowary</h2>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>TCassowaries live in tropical rainforests, melaleuca (paperbark) swamps, mangrove forests woodlands and can even be found foraging along beaches. They require this diverse range of habitats to ensure availability of fleshy fruits year round.</p>
                <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
                <p>TThe Australian Southern Cassowary is listed as an Endangered species at both the Queensland State and Australian Government levels. Key threats have been identified as habitat loss, vehicle strikes, dog attacks and the increasing frequency of natural disasters.</p>
                <h3>Behavior</h3>    
                <p>Cassowaries make deep booming and rumbling noises, and hiss when threatened. For such a large bird, they're quite elusive. Typically shy and solitary, they can become aggressive when threatened.</p>
                <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Lionfish have distinctive brown or maroon, and white stripes or bands covering the head and body. They have fleshy tentacles above their eyes and below the mouth; fan-like pectoral fins; long, separated dorsal spines; 13 dorsal spines; 10-11 dorsal soft rays; 3 anal spines; and 6-7 anal soft rays.</p>
                        <h3>Role in the Ecosystem</h3>
                        <p>Lionfish feed on prey normally consumed by snappers, groupers, and other commercially important native species. This means their presence could negatively affect the well-being of valuable commercial and recreational fisheries. As lionfish populations grow, they put additional stress on coral reefs.</p>

                They are the only

                that breeds during
                the harsh

              <h2>Bald Eagle</h2>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>The Bald Eagle
                is native to
                North America,
                commonly found
                near large
                bodies of open
                water, such as
                lakes, rivers,
                and marshes.
                These areas
                provide the
                eagle with an
                abundant food
                supply,
                particularly fish.
                They build large
                nests in tall
                trees or on cliffs
                in these
                habitats. They
                are most often
                seen in the
                northern parts of
                North America,
                but can also be
                found in parts of
                Canada and
                Mexico. </p>

                Status</h3>
                <p>The Bald Eagle
                  was once listed
                  as endangered
                  in the United
                  States, but it
                  has been
                  removed from
                  the list due to
                  successful
                  recovery efforts.
                  Conservation
                  efforts, such as
                  banning the
                  pesticide DDT
                  and protecting
                  habitats, led to a
                  significant
                  population

                  now, the Bald

                  classified as
                  "Least Concern"
                  by the

                      fish-eaters but
                      will also hunt
                      small mammals
                      and birds. Bald
                      Eagles are
                      solitary hunters
                      and are
                      excellent at
                      flying at high
                      altitudes to spot
                      prey. They mate
                      for life and
                      engage in aerial
                      displays during

                  <p>Koalas are

                    spend most of their
                    lives sleeping in
                    the trees. They are

                    which are low in
                    nutrients and

                <p>Lovebirds are native to the forests, savannas, and grasslands of Africa, including Madagascar. They prefer warm climates and are often found in woodlands, shrubs, and areas near water sources. Some species, like the Rosy-faced Lovebird, have also adapted to urban environments.</p>
                <h3>Conservation
                    Status</h3>
                    <p>lovebirds varies by species. While many species are listed as Least Concern by the IUCN, some, like the Black-cheeked Lovebird (Agapornis nigrigenis), are considered Vulnerable due to habitat loss and capture for the pet trade. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their natural habitat and preventing illegal trade.</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Lovebirds are highly social and form strong pair bonds, often seen preening each other as a sign of affection. They are active, playful, and intelligent, capable of mimicking sounds and solving simple puzzles. In the wild, they live in small flocks and communicate through high-pitched calls.</p>

                        Characteristics</h3>
                        <p>Lovebirds are small, stocky parrots typically measuring between 5 to 7 inches (13 to 17 cm) in length. They have a short, blunt tail and a strong, curved beak that helps them crack open seeds and fruits. Their plumage is usually bright and colorful, with shades of green being the most common, often complemented by vibrant hues of red, yellow, orange, or blue, depending on the species.</p>

                            <p>Lovebirds contribute to the ecosystem by dispersing seeds, which helps in plant growth and regeneration. They also play a role in pollination by feeding on nectar. As prey for larger birds and animals, they are an essential part of the food chain, maintaining ecological balance.</p>
