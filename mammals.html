              <h2>Artic Fox / <i>Vulpes lagopus</i></h2>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>The Arctic fox is native to the cold, tundra regions of the Arctic and
                subarctic, found across North America, Europe, and Asia. They inhabit open plains, coastal areas, and icy
                environments where temperatures can drop below freezing for long periods. Arctic
                foxes are specially adapted to live in such extreme conditions</p>
                <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
                <p>The Arctic fox is
                    classified as
                    "Least Concern"
                    by the IUCN, but
                    some populations
                    face threats due
                    to climate change,
                    habitat loss, and
                    competition with
                    the red fox, which
                    is moving into the
                    Arctic regions due
                    to warming
                    temperatures.</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Arctic foxes are
                      solitary hunters
                      and are active
                      year-round, even
                      in the harsh
                      winter months.
                      They are
                      omnivores,
                      feeding on a diet
                      of lemmings,
                      birds, eggs, and
                      occasionally
                      berries. They are
                      well adapted to
                      extreme cold and
                      can survive
                      freezing
                      temperatures by
                      growing thick fur
                      coats and
                      burrowing into the
                      snow.</p>
                    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Arctic foxes have
                        a dense,
                        insulating coat of
                        fur, which is white
                        in the winter to
                        blend with the
                        snow and brown
                        or gray in the
                        summer to
                        provide
                        camouflage in the
                        tundra. They have
                        short legs, a
                        rounded body,
                        and a bushy tail,
                        all of which help
                        conserve body
                        heat.</p>
                        <h3>Role in the Ecosystem</h3>
                        <p>Arctic foxes play
                            an important
                            role in
                            controlling
                            populations of
                            small mammals,
                            particularly
                            lemmings, which
                            are a primary
                            food source for
                            many Arctic
                            predators. They
                            are also
                            scavengers and
                            help clean up
                            animal carcasses
                            in their

              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>Giant pandas are
                native to the
                mountainous
                regions of central
                China, primarily
                found in the
                Sichuan, Shaanxi,
                and Gansu
                provinces. They
                live in temperate
                bamboo forests,
                at elevations
                between 5,000
                and 10,000 feet.
                These areas offer
                a cool, wet
                climate and are
                rich in bamboo,
                which constitutes
                nearly 99% of
                their diet.</p>

              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>Jaguars are
              primarily found in
              the rainforests of
              Central and South
              America, though
              their range also
              extends into
              scrublands and
              grasslands. They
              prefer dense
              vegetation near
              water sources
              such as rivers,
              lakes, and
              wetlands, where
              they hunt for prey
              like capybaras,
              caimans, and
              peccaries.</p>
              <h3>Conservation
                Status</h3>
                <p>The jaguar is
                    listed as "Near
                    Threatened" by
                    the IUCN due to
                    habitat loss,
                    poaching, and the
                    encroachment of
                    human
                    settlements. They
                    are often hunted
                    for their beautiful
                    pelts, and their
                    territories are
                    being fragmented
                    by deforestation

                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Jaguars are
                        solitary and
                        elusive animals.
                        They are known
                        for their powerful
                        bite, capable of
                        crushing the
                        skulls of their prey
                        with ease. Unlike
                        other big cats,
                        jaguars often hunt
                        alone and are
                        adept swimmers,
                        preying on a wide
                        variety of animals,
                        from deer to
                        aquatic creatures
                        like fish and
                        turtles. They are
                        also known for
                        their ability to
                        climb trees. </p>

                <h2>Giraffe / <i>Giraffa camelopardalis</i></h2>
                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are native to sub-Saharan Africa, where they inhabit open woodlands, savannas, and grasslands. They prefer areas with acacia trees and other vegetation for feeding, as they primarily browse on the leaves from tall trees. Giraffes are often found in areas with abundant water sources, though they can survive for long periods without drinking.</p>
                <h3>Conservation
                    Status</h3>
                    <p>The Giraffe is currently listed as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List. Over the past several decades, giraffe populations have declined due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. While some subspecies are more endangered than others, conservation efforts are ongoing to stabilize their numbers.</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes are social animals, living in loose herds of 10 to 20 individuals. These herds are usually composed of females and their offspring, with males often living solitary lives or forming bachelor groups. Giraffes are known for their unique feeding behavior, where they use their long necks to browse the upper branches of trees. They communicate through low-frequency sounds and body movements.</p>
                    <h3>Physical
                        Characteristics</h3>
                        <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals, with males reaching up to 18 feet and females slightly shorter. They have long necks, legs, and distinctive spotted coats. Their tongues, which can grow up to 18 inches in length, are well adapted for grasping leaves.</p>
                        <h3>Role in the
                            Ecosystem   </h3>
                            <p>Giraffes play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of their ecosystem. By browsing on tall trees, they help control tree growth, which allows for more sunlight to reach the grass below, promoting plant diversity. They also serve as prey for large predators, providing a food source for lions and hyenas.</p>

                <h2>Cheetah / <i>Acinonyx jubatus.</i></h2>
                <h3>Habitat</h3>
                <p>Currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, cheetahs face significant threats to their survival, primarily habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and the illegal wildlife trade. They are found in a variety of habitats across Africa and a small population remains in Iran.</p>
                <h3>Conservation
                    Status</h3>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>cheetahs display a mix of solitary and group behavior. Female cheetahs are mostly independent, except when raising their cubs, while males often form coalitions, usually with their brothers, to defend territory and increase their hunting success. Unlike other big cats, they are not highly territorial but still mark their areas to deter rivals. Mothers play a crucial role in teaching their cubs survival skills, including hunting and avoiding danger.</p>
                    <h3>Physical
                        Characteristics</h3>
                        <p>Their physical characteristics are perfectly adapted for their role as a supreme sprinter. They possess a slender, muscular body with long, powerful legs and a deep chest. Their lightweight build, combined with their flexible spine and long tail, allows them to achieve incredible speeds. Their unique spotted coat provides effective camouflage in their grassy savanna habitats.</p>
                        <h3>Role in the
                            Ecosystem   </h3>
                            <p>Cheetahs play a vital role in their ecosystem as apex predators, helping to regulate prey populations and maintain the balance of their habitats. Their hunting success contributes to the health and diversity of the savanna ecosystem.</p>
