            <div class="description">
              Also known as the monkey-eating eagle, is one of the largest and most powerful eagles in the world. Found primarily in the mountain forests of the Philippines, this eagle has striking features, including a large, crest-like head, sharp talons, and powerful wings. It is an apex predator and is considered critically endangered due to habitat loss, deforestation, and hunting. Its diet mainly consists of monkeys, large lizards, and other forest animals.

              A small species of wild buffalo endemic to the island of Mindoro. Characterized by its stocky build and short, straight horns, the Tamaraw is much smaller than its relatives, the water buffalo. It inhabits grasslands and forests and feeds on a variety of vegetation. The Tamaraw is critically endangered due to hunting, habitat loss, and competition with domesticated animals.

              A tiny primate that is native to the Philippines and is one of the smallest primates in the world. These nocturnal creatures are known for their large eyes, which help them navigate in low-light conditions. Tarsiers have elongated fingers and toes that assist them in leaping between trees. They primarily feed on insects, small vertebrates, and other invertebrates.

              The world's longest venomous snake, growing up to 18 feet long.

Unlike many other snakes, the King Cobra primarily feeds on other snakes, including venomous species. Its venom can cause paralysis and death, making it a dangerous predator.

      <h1>Animal Classes</h1>
      <p>An animal class is made up of animals that are all alike in important ways.  Scientists have grouped animals into classes to make it easier to study them.

          <h2>Mammals</h2>
          <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals covered in hair or fur, 
            and they give birth to live young (except monotremes like the platypus, which lay eggs).
            One of their most defining features is the presence of mammary glands,
            which allow mothers to nurse their young. Mammals breathe through lungs and have a 
            highly developed brain, making them one of the most intelligent animal groups. 
            They can be found in a variety of habitats, from land (lions, elephants) to the ocean (whales, dolphins)
            and even the sky (bats).</p>

          <h2>Fish</h2>
          <p>Fish, in contrast, are cold-blooded aquatic animals that live entirely in water. 
            They have gills for breathing, which allows them to extract oxygen from water.
             Unlike mammals, fish have scales covering their bodies and use fins for movement. Most fish lay eggs, though some, like sharks, give birth to live young. 
             Fish are the largest group of vertebrates, with thousands of species, including freshwater fish like goldfish and marine fish like sharks and tuna.</p>

          <h2>Birds</h2>
          <p>Birds are another distinct class of vertebrates known for their feathers, beaks, and wings. 
            They are warm-blooded and lay hard-shelled eggs. Most birds have hollow bones, making them lightweight and well-adapted for flight, 
            although some species, like penguins and ostriches, are flightless. Birds also have unique respiratory systems that allow them to take in more oxygen,
             helping them sustain flight for long distances. Examples of birds include eagles, parrots, and swans.</p>

          <h2>Amphibians</h2>
          <p>Amphibians, belonging to the class Amphibia, include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. 
            They are unique for their dual life, beginning as aquatic larvae before undergoing metamorphosis into terrestrial or semi-aquatic adults. 
            Amphibians have moist, permeable skin that allows them to breathe through their skin in addition to their lungs. Due to this,
            they depend on wet or damp environments to prevent dehydration.</p>

          <h2>Reptiles</h2>
          <p>Reptiles, classified under Reptilia, include snakes, lizards, turtles, and crocodiles. 
            Unlike amphibians, reptiles have scaly, waterproof skin that enables them to thrive in drier environments. 
            They lay amniotic eggs with protective shells, reducing their dependence on water for reproduction.
             Most reptiles rely on lungs for breathing throughout their lives and have a more developed circulatory and respiratory system, 
             making them better suited for life on land.</p>
