              <h2>Clown Fish</h2>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>Clownfish are found in warm waters, such as the Red Sea and Pacific Oceans, in sheltered reefs or lagoons, living in anemone</p>
                <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
                <p>The conservation status of clownfish is least concern, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. However, clownfish populations have decreased in some areas due to overfishing and habitat loss</p>
                <h3>Behavior</h3>
                <p>Clownfish are found singly, in pairs, and in small groups. They rarely move more than 30 cm (12 in) from the protection of their host anemone. They are territorial, aggressively defending their host and an area around it.</p>
                <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>The body shape of clownfish is perch-likeâ€”oval and laterally compressed with an interrupted lateral line. Their body color is a bright orange with three white bars, the middle with a forward bulge centrally. Thick black bands around the white bars separate the orange and white portions of the body.</p>
                        <h3>Role in the Ecosystem</h3>
                        <p>The anemone protect the clownfish from predators and provide food scraps. In return, the clownfish uses its bright colours to lure fish into the anemone, where they are killed by the anemone's poison and eaten. The clownfish also fertilises the anemone with its faeces.</p>

              <h2>African LionFish </h2>
              <h3>Habitat</h3>
              <p>Lionfish are found in mostly all marine habitat types found in warm marine waters of the tropics. Lionfish have been found in water depths from 1 to 300 feet on hard bottom, mangrove, seagrass, coral, and artificial reefs (like shipwrecks)</p>
                <h3>Conservation
                    Status</h3>
                    <p>The African lionfish is not listed as a species of significant conservation concern by major organizations such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It is typically categorized as a species of "Least Concern" due to its wide distribution and relatively stable populations in its native range, which includes the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
                        <h3>Behavior</h3>
                        <p>Lionfish are thought to be nocturnal hunters, but they have been found with full stomachs during the day in the Atlantic. They move about by slowly undulating the soft rays of the dorsal and anal fins</p>
                            <h3>Physical
                                Characteristics</h3>
                                <p>Lionfish have distinctive brown or maroon, and white stripes or bands covering the head and body. They have fleshy tentacles above their eyes and below the mouth; fan-like pectoral fins; long, separated dorsal spines; 13 dorsal spines; 10-11 dorsal soft rays; 3 anal spines; and 6-7 anal soft rays.</p>
                                    <h3>Role in the
                                        Ecosystem</h3>
                                        <p>Lionfish feed on prey normally consumed by snappers, groupers, and other commercially important native species. This means their presence could negatively affect the well-being of valuable commercial and recreational fisheries. As lionfish populations grow, they put additional stress on coral reefs.</p>
